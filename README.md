Projects:

1. generic web server - this code enables web developers use a predefined simple backend mostly for test purposes that handles GET requests for resources loaded into the machine's RAM, thus enabling real time changes to the front end minus down time. The local Front-End files can even be deleted during program runtime, without intterupting its functionality *AT ALL*.  The program is equiped with a set of commands during runtime for managment purposes such as loading the current resources directory again after changes were made.
