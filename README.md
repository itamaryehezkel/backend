# web services

This readme is associated with upcoming scripts and projects focusing on 
a Java based Back-End and various Front-End solutions and projects.

Each related project will be named and described in the following list where new scripts will be denoted as "upcoming" or "incomplete" adequately to the projects' states.

Projects:

1. generic web server - this code enables web developers use a predefined simple backend mostly for test purposes that handles GET requests for resources loaded into the machine's RAM, thus enabling real time changes to the front end minus down time. The local Front-End files can even be deleted during program runtime, without intterupting its functionality *AT ALL*.  The program is equiped with a set of commands during runtime for managment purposes such as loading the current resources directory again after changes were made.

2. *UPCOMING* a customized web media player - This project is new. The purpose is to develop a media player compatible with all types of streams such as hlv,m3u8,mp4 (ect.) while preserving the MP's versatility code-wise, meaning it will be built in a way that DOES let other programmers reshape the media player to their fittings.
